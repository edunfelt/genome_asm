The aim of this project is to analyze a large data file containing overlap information between DNA segments. The data comes from shotgun sequencing of the Norway spruce, on which contig overlaps has been computed. By visualizing this data as a graph in which a node corresponds to a contig and an edge corresponds to a contig overlap it is possible to gain an overview of the data. In particular, it is interesting to know how many overlaps a particular contig has, that is, to find the degree of the nodes in the graph, and also to know how many and how large the overlapping parts are. So, among other things, it is of interest to know the degree distribution, the number of connected components, and the component size distribution.
